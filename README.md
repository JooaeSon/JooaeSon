👋 Hello My name is Jooae. I am a back-end developer.

My major is Global Media✨. Through the media department, I have experienced various 4th industry fields such as development, service planning, design, etc. I decided to develop it myself through various experiences. I am a developer who dreams of developing IT services considering user convenience and necessity. The main languages I use are Java and Python. I ran the service through number 2 for team project experience using Java-based Spring Framework. The main areas of interest are <b>web development</b> and <b>computer vision</b> that people can use and interact with in their daily lives.
