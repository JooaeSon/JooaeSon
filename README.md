My major is <b>GLOBAL SCHOOL OF MEDIA, IT University</b>✨. Through the media department, I have experienced various 4th industry fields such as development, service planning, design, etc. I decided to develop it myself through various experiences.

I developed the service through number 2 for team project experience using Java-based Spring Framework. The main interests are <b>web development</b> and <b>computer vision</b> that people can use and interact with in their daily lives.
